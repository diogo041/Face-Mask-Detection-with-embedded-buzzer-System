# Face-Mask-Detection-with-embedded-buzzer-System
In the present Covid-19 scenario, there are no efficient face mask detection applications which would detect the Safety Accuracy % of the Person wearing a mask .  Our Software is a Real-Time ,Research-Oriented project , which will be built by analyzing the percentage of people in a public place wearing a mask and vice versa with maximum accuracy.  Being a Data Science Project, we aim to learn concepts like Data Visualization and Presentation, Data Analytics, Deep learning, Machine learning , Computer vision  along  with various  python libraries.
